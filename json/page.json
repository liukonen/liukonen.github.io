Let's be honest though, that's only a small sliver of who I am. I've been in development for over 15 years professionally. My focus has been mainly on backend development, however, I have worked as a full-stack developer. I have been fascinated with the direction technology could take us, and was a huge fan of how we would interact with it in the future. To this day, I like to consider myself a technologist, reading up on current trends, and what progress we are making in the field.",

I had an AIML source code project, which I tied with an MS agent, and TTS, with speach recognition, and I was talking to a bot, and it was responding. Few years later, and the AIM code cant connect, so I found AIML and the Alice project. 2016 hits, and at work, Im asked to present for MMAC Be The Spark tour, where my project, Sarra, tied her with Alice (and updated some of the scripts) as well as Microsoft cognitive services and presented a vocal chat bot that could detect and translate on the fly.
