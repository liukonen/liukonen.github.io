            "summary": "As a Summer Instructor at ITT Technical Institute, I had the opportunity to teach two courses: Introduction to Programming and Introduction to Computers. These experiences helped me develop a managerial approach, as I learned that it is often best to guide people to the answer rather than simply giving it to them. I honed my skills in administrative tasks, time management, and managing multiple people at once, all of which were essential to the success of the courses. Overall, my time at ITT Tech allowed me to develop my teaching skills and provided valuable insights into effective leadership and management."
