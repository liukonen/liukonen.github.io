    "welcome": "My name is Luke Liukonen, and I am a Senior Software Engineer, educator, and tech enthusiast based out of the Metro Milwaukee Wisconsin area. Let's be honest though, that's only a small sliver of who I am. I've been in development for over 14 years professionally, spending most of my time in the travel space. My main focus is backend development, however, I have transitioned to more of a full stack developer. I have  been fascinated with the direction technology could take us, and was a huge fan of how we would interact with them in the future. To this day, I like to consider myself a technologist, reading up on current trends, and what progress we are making in the field.",
