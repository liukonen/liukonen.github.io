I found the original source code, and re wrote it in .net.  and since they were all based on the same source, consolidate the logic to one program, with options to switch math types (divide, multiply, add, and subtract) Since I have some time off, I was able to rewrite this using Javascript and HTML, and bring back Agents and text to speach over the browser.",

I had an AIM source code project, which I tied with an MS agent, and TTS, with speach recognition, and I was talking to a bot, and it was responding. Few years later, and the AIM code cant connect, so I found AIML and the Alice project. 2016 hits, and at work, Im asked to present for MMAC Be The Spark tour, where my project, Sarra, tied her with Alice (and updated some of the scripts) as well as Microsoft cognitive services and presented a vocal chat bot that could detect and translate on the fly. Desided to take the AIML code and migrate it to RiveScript and make a bot out of it.",
