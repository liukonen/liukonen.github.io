And a client, built in Vue.JS, and hosted on github pages. Around 2002, 2003, I was interested in taking the chat bot out out of the standard container. I had an AIML source code project, which I tied with an MS agent, and TTS, with speach recognition, and I was talking to a bot, and it was responding. Few years later, and the AIM code cant connect, so I found AIML and the Alice project. 2016 hits, and at work, Im asked to present for MMAC Be The Spark tour, where my project, Sarra, tied her with Alice (and updated some of the scripts) as well as Microsoft cognitive services and presented a vocal chat bot that could detect and translate on the fly. Desided to take the AIML code and migrate it to RiveScript and make a bot out of it.",
